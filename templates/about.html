      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>{{ config.SITE_NAME }} exists to provide accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date information for Nigerians looking to relocate abroad. We understand that the decision to "japa" (emigrate) is one of the most significant life choices anyone can make, and we believe everyone deserves access to reliable information to make informed decisions.</p>

      <p>Too many Nigerians have fallen victim to misinformation, scams, and poor advice when pursuing international opportunities. Our mission is to change that by providing free, quality content that covers every aspect of the relocation journey—from visa applications to settling into a new country.</p>

      <h2>What We Cover</h2>
      <p>Our guides cover the most popular destinations for Nigerian emigrants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Skilled Worker Visas, Care Worker Visas, Student Visas, and settlement</li>
        <li><strong>Canada:</strong> Express Entry, Provincial Nominee Programs, Study Permits</li>
        <li><strong>Germany:</strong> Opportunity Card, EU Blue Card, Study Visas</li>
        <li><strong>Australia:</strong> Skilled Migration, Student Visas</li>
        <li><strong>United States:</strong> H1B, F1, Green Card pathways</li>
        <li><strong>Ireland:</strong> Critical Skills Employment Permits</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We also provide guides on essential topics like IELTS preparation, proof of funds documentation, CV writing, job searching, and financial planning for relocation.</p>

        <li><strong>Practical:</strong> We include actionable steps, real costs, and realistic timelines</li>

        <li><strong>Free:</strong> All our content is freely accessible to everyone</li>
      </ul>
